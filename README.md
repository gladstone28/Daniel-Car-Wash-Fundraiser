The Agenda for the First meeting is in this folder


Fundraiser: Daniel House Car Wash
When: Saturday. November 2, 2024
Time: 10am to 4pm
Cost: $1500 for Cars & $2000 for SUVs

The plan is to invite persons to purchase tickets ahead of time and share whether or not they will be in attendance so that we can have an idea of the number of vehicles we should expect. Those getting their vehicle washed, would be invited to sit under the canopy by the entrance of the church, and a cool drink and/or snack will be served while they wait. Music will be played throughout our time there. 

From the proceeds, the House is proposing to offer 2% (and no more than $XXXX) of the amount collected to go towards the church's water bill.
